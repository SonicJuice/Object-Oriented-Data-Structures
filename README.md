# Python ADTs
Object-oriented implementations of various abstract data types!

- Doubly Linked List

- Stack

- Hash Table (utilising Murmur3 for deterministic indexes that minimise collision rate)

- Vector (utilising Graham Scan to compute convex hulls viewable with which matplotlib)

## Queues
- Queue
  
- Circular Queue
  
- Priority Queue (utilising heap rules to maintain a logical order)
  
## Graphs
- Graph (utilising an adjacency list for directed or undirected graphs, depth-first and breadth-first traversal, and Dijsktra's algorithm)

- Binary Search Tree (utilising in-, pre-, and post-order traversal, and a balancing method)

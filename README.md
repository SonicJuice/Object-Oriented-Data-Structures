# Python ADTs
Object-oriented implementations of various abstract data types!

These include:

- Queue

- Circular Queue

- Priority Queue (utilising heap rules to maintain a logical order)

- Linked List (utilising double linking for bi-directional node traversal)

- Stack

- Hash Table (utilising Murmur3 for deterministic indexes that minimise collision rate)

- Graph (utilising an adjacency list for directed or undirected graphs, depth-first and breadth-first traversal, and Dijsktra's algorithm)

- Binary Search Tree (utilising in-, pre-, and post-order traversal, and a balancing method)

- Vector (utilising Graham Scan to compute convex hulls viewable with which matplotlib)

# Python Abstract Data Types
Object-oriented implementations of various abstract data types!

These include:

- Linear Queue

- Circular Queue

- Priority Queue (utilising heap rules to maintain a logical order)

- Linked List (w/ double linking for bi-directional node traversal and, therefore, O(1) insertion and deletion)

- Stack

- Hash Table (utilising Murmur3 hashing for deterministic hash indexes that minimise collision rate)

- Graph (utilising an adjacency list for either directed or undirected graphs, w/ depth-first and breadth-first traversal methods, as well as Dijsktra's algorithm)

- Binary Search Tree (w/ in, pre, and post-order traversal methods, as well as a balancing method)

- Vector (w/ Graham Scan to compute the convex hulls, which can then be displayed via matplotlib)
